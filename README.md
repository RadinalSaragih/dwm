# dwm - dynamic window manager
My Bloated build of Suckless's dwm window manager.

## Installation
* A basic "make install" would do the job.
```sh
sudo make install
```
## Build Dependencies
* Debian Based Distros
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0 libxft-dev \
	libxinerama-dev libxcb1-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-res0-dev
```
Note: libxft >= 2.3.5 (to use colored fonts)
