# dwm - dynamic window manager
This is my bloated build of the Suckless's Dynamic Window Manager
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

### Installation
A basic make install would do the job.

```sh
sudo make install
```

#### Dependencies
Debian Based Distros

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0 libxft-dev libxinerama-dev
```
