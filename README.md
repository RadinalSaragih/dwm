## dwm - dynamic window manager
This is my bloated build of the Suckless's Dynamic Window Manager.  
"dwm" is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. 

## 
### Installation
* A basic "make install" would do the job.
```sh
sudo make install
```

### Build Dependencies
* Debian Based Distros
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0 libxft-dev libxinerama-dev
```

## 
##### Note: The manpage is kinda up to date, But to be sure just read the source files (most importantly dwm.c and config.h).
